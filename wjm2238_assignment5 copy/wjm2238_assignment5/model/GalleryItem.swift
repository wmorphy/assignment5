//    Create a class, GalleryItem to hold the gallery item's image and label. You should load this data from a custom plist, which you can create by selecting New -> File -> iOS -> Resource -> Property List. To store this information in a plist, make the root of type Array, then include items of type Dictionary. The item's dictionary key-value pair will be the name of the image (included in the Assets.xcassets folder) and an associated caption of your choosing.
